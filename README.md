## Overview

Verdict Protocol is an AI-powered on-chain intelligence layer built 
for real users.

On one side: a smart money tracking and on-chain anomaly detection 
system — delivering live risk signals, whale movements, and wallet 
intelligence across 8 EVM chains through a Telegram Bot built for 
how traders actually operate.

On the other: a gamified, shareable consumer AI application that turns 
any on-chain disagreement into a live wager — between friends, rivals, 
or communities — with results that spread as verifiable, shareable cards.

Two products. One AI Judge core. Built on BNB Chain. Expanding to Mantle.

## Track 02 — AI Alpha & Data Intelligence

Information asymmetry is a structural problem across all of Web3. 
Verdict Protocol addresses this through two channels: a Chrome 
extension and a Telegram Bot, both powered by the same AI Judge core.

The Chrome extension auto-detects contract addresses on DexScreener, 
GMGN, four.meme, and Ave.ai, delivering real-time risk scores and AI 
verdicts in seconds. The Telegram Bot provides deep wallet scanning, 
real-time whale tracking, and large transfer monitoring — covering 
8 EVM chains including Mantle, BNB Chain, Ethereum, Arbitrum, 
Optimism, Base, Polygon, and Avalanche.

**Data layer:** Moralis multi-chain API  
**Inference layer:** Large Language Model (LLM)

## Track 04 — Protocol Bet

Any disagreement can become a verifiable on-chain wager. Protocol Bet 
lets anyone create a bet on any on-chain event — token performance, 
market direction, or any disputed claim.

Use cases range from casual bets between friends (share a private link), 
to open challenges seeking any counterparty, to public disputes between 
KOLs or communities with opposing views. After settlement, results are 
automatically generated as shareable cards — fully verifiable on-chain.

No trusted intermediary required. The initiator sets the target, 
direction, time window, and stake amount. Once accepted, the contract 
locks funds and settles automatically on expiry. Transparent, automated, 
unstoppable.

把这段内容写进本地文件用这条命令：

```bash
cat > README.md << 'ENDOFFILE'
（把上面全部内容粘贴进来）
ENDOFFILE
```

不过这样手动粘贴容易出错，更简单的方式是我直接生成一个文件，你用 `curl` 或者直接在编辑器里替换。你更习惯哪种方式？
